## Challenge

While it's too easy to support one or two filters at same time manualy.
The challenge of this task was to supporting N* of filters, while we dont know the number of filters before fetching the data from server. I mean state manager inside Reactjs when get data from API.

## More about the project

We are building a own ecommerce platform and what we faced in is to handling different filters of a product in React JS.

I have to explain more to you for make it sense.
For a single product page, maybe there are multi filters.
for examples:

- Colors
- Sizes
- RAM
- Disk space

and each of that filter has some options. for example: Colors has RED, BLUE, GREEN, etc.

### And so

I think this is still buggy and if you want to contribute or do your bets or a nice and cool JS challenge. it's for you.

Any kind of contribution are welcome.

### What? Yes i think need to rewrite!

After doing this i get some tips about the topic and I think if I again start to rewrite I can do a better and more clean version.

I not bad JS developer but I think I need a JS mentor myself to guide me to write more clean programs!
